I am a second year masters student at the university of colorado Boulder.  I am a technology enthusiast who enjoys learning about new technology and helping others incorporate it to make themselves more productive.
I am currently working on a project called "Smart cane," which is an end-to-end AI system assisting visually impaired people in doing grocery shopping. It takes the camera feed from the camera, finds the target product in the grocery shelf using neural networks, and guides the visually impaired person towards picking up the product from the shelf. 
The project paper is published at the AAMAS conference, London 2022-a tire one conference in the field of robotics. 

Priviouls I have worked as a software engineer at Cisco Systems, Bengaluru. during my time at cisco I have worked on the distribueted infra componets of XR operating system.
