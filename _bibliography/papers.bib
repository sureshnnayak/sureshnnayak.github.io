  title={ShelfHelp: Empowering Humans to Perform Vision-Independent Manipulation Tasks with a Socially Assistive Robotic Cane},
  author={Shvendra Agarwal, Suresh N Nayak, Ashutish Naik, Bradly Heys},
  abstract={The ability to shop independently, especially in grocery stores,
is important for maintaining a high quality of life. This can be
particularly challenging for people with visual impairments (PVI).
Stores carry thousands of products, with approximately 30,000
new products introduced each year in the US market alone, presenting a challenge even for modern computer vision solutions.
Through this work, we present a proof-of-concept socially assistive robotic system we call ShelfHelp, and propose novel technical
solutions for enhancing instrumented canes traditionally meant for
navigation tasks with additional capability within the domain of
shopping. ShelfHelp includes a novel visual product locator algorithm designed for use in grocery stores and a novel planner that
autonomously issues verbal manipulation guidance commands to
guide the user during product retrieval. Through a human subjects
study, we show the system’s success in locating and providing effective manipulation guidance to retrieve desired products with
novice users. We compare two autonomous verbal guidance modes
achieving comparable performance to a human assistance baseline
and present encouraging findings that validate our system’s efficiency and effectiveness and through positive subjective metrics
including competence, intelligence, and ease of use.},
