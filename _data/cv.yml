      institution:  Collaborative Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory, University of colorado Boulder, US
      year: 2022
      description:
        - •	Generated hand movement dataset using Opti-Track sensor and emulated the system on RealSense D435 Camera using Deep learning algorithms and set up the cross-platform data computing using Robotic operation system.
        - •	Trained and unsedYOLOv5 Model on SKU110k Dataset to identify grocery items on the shelf with an accuracy of 93%.

    - title: Graduate Teaching Assistant.
      institution: University of Colorado Boulder

    - title: Software Engineering Intern
      institution: Cisco Systems
      year: Jan 2018 - Aug 2018
      description:
        - •	Redesigned a software mechanism to monitor the liveness of process in Cisco XR routers and provide a means of recovering it whenever a critical process gets hung. Feature is currently deployed in the XR routers resulting in bug count by 10%.
        - •	Devised a feature related to high availability components (in-memory database) during product release cycle efficiency reducing workload overhead by 80%.
        - •	Developed a feature for Private line emulation (a Cisco patented project) to encapsulate other network packets in OTN packets. enabling customers to leverage existing infrastructure to connect to an OTN network with zero hardware cost.
        - •	Migrated software components from GCC to Clang Compiler enforcing inter component tight coupling, helping team achieve bug count less than 10.
